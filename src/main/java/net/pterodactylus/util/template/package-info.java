/**
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * The template system is used like this:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Template template = new Template(new FileReader("template.html"));
 * template.set("variable", "value");
 * template.set("items", Arrays.asList("foo", "bar", "baz"));
 * template.render(outputWriter);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Handling custom types</h2>
 *
 * <p>
 * The template system can be extended using
 * {@link net.pterodactylus.util.template.Accessor}s. An accessor is used to
 * allow template variable syntax like “object.foo”. Depending on the type of
 * {@code object}  the appropriate accessor is used to find the value of the
 * member “foo” (which can e.g. be retrieved by calling a complicated operation
 * on {@code object}).
 * </p>
